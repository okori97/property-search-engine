# Property Search Engine

## Description

I am building a property search engine, similar to Rightmove or Zoopla. In completing this project, I plan to demonstrate an understanding of such as:

The following functionalities need to be implemented:

- A listings page where you can search for different properties and sort/filter the results.
- An add property page where you will add new properties.
- A property page.
